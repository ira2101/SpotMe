We have all been in a situation where we have had trouble finding parking. Whether going to a professional sports event or traveling to a busy city, it can be extremely challenging and stressful trying to find parking, and it can be a great waste of time as well. Currently, there exist some parking apps which can inform you about nearby parking lots; however, if all of the nearby parking lots are full, which does happen many times, then it seems that you are out of luck and you have to circle around these parking lots until a spot becomes available or take a gamble and scavenge elsewhere for a different spot. One thing that these apps donâ€™t do is give people the opportunity to enter their own properties as available parking locations, which someone can then reserve on the app when they need parking. This would open up a whole new area for parking; it would open up countless more parking spots for people to use, and it would also save people a lot of time and stress because they can choose parking spots closer to their destination and their parking spot would already be reserved on the app, and so all they would have to do is show up at their reserved location to park.
